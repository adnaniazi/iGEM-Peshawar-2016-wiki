He gave us the privilege to inaugurate the newly established state&ndash;of&ndash;the&ndash;art biology lab of his institute with iGEM research. His integrative skills of biology, statistics, innovation, and business helped us at every step of the project from marketing to the recruitment of the team, from lab work to Human practices, and from poster design to computational modeling. He gave us hope when everything seemed impossible. iGEM team Peshawar would not have been possible without his efforts.
