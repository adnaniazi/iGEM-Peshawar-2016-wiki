                                <p>Hello world! I am Ismail from Karachi, the city by the sea and I wish to to solve and revolutionize the way we deal with real world problems with the help of synthetic biology.</p>
                                <p>I enjoy reading about science, history, politics, and people who have changed the world. I love to travel, meet new people, have new experiences and I usually spend my free time either swimming and diving off the coast of Karachi, or having crazy road trips with my friends. I believe that anger and hate are two of humanity's most dangerous enemies, and the world can be a much better place if we all become a little more compassionate, open, and understanding. After all, we are all 99.9% the same &mdash; DNA&ndash;wise.</p>

                                <p>I hop and hope too much as there is an perpetual voice echoing a big'ol optimistic 'Yes' in my heart. Synthetic biology, to me, is an amalgam of art and science: it has colors, patterns, and beauty that intrigue me. </p>
                                <p>I am magnetized towards creative and intellectual people. I am not genius &mdash; rather a genuine person who gets all the creative ideas, either artistic or scientific, from my own real dreams. I do archery, painting and photography, and like to go on long drives. I fear maths and therefore, love doing it. My thirst for learning new things and skills is never ending. </p>

                                <p>As an aspiring molecular biologist, I love to unravel the mysteries of life sciences. I believe my place is in the wet lab. I want to develop sustainable technologies which can bring a positive change in the near future. </p>
